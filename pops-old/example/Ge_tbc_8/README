Example: Fit the Tersoff potential for Ge to forces, energies, and stresses of 8 atom DFT configurations.

***** See the "README" file in every directory for a description of the process. *****

The directories are organized as follows: A "1" at the beginning of a directory means that this is the first step. "2" means seconds step, etc.. 

Folders included in this directory:

1_dft: Getting DFT configurations and organizing them into the proper format is the first step.
2_fitting: The next step is to fit using the configurations.

NOTE: All .m files used in this example are written in Octave, not MATLAB.
