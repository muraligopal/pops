Generate volume configurations for fitting to pressure and energy at different volumes.

Procedure:
1) This is the same procedure as generating configurations to calculate the lattice parameter.
	a) Just be sure to use more configurations around the calculated lattice parameter so that this area can be well captured in 		   fitting.
	b) 20-30 configurations is sufficient (maybe even less).
2) After generating the configurations and running them using "gen_moduli_config_files.sh" and "gen_moduli_configs.sh", use "getoutcars.sh" to organize all of the OUTCAR files into /outcar_house.
3) Go into /outcar_house and run "gen_configs.m" to generate a CONFIGS file that contains all of the atom types, positions, forces, stresses, and cohesive energies for each configuration. 
	a) Edit "gen_configs.m" accordingly.
	b) Be sure to edit the "eatoms" variable in "gen_configs.m". This is the combined energy of all the INDIVIDUAL atoms in the 		   system, where we calculate the energy of an individual atom earlier.
