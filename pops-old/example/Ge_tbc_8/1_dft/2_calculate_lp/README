Using the converged number of k-points, we know calculate the equilibium lattice parameter (volume) using curve fitting.

Procedure:
1) Make a POSCAR with direct coordinates for your system. See the /files directory.
2) Put the necessary VASP input files into /files.
3) Use "gen_moduli_config_files.sh" to generate more directories for different configurations of different volumes (or lattice parameters). This script simply edits the box size in POSCAR.
	a) The files will be labeled with a number corresponding to their lattice parameter.
4) Use "gen_moduli_configs.sh"  to loop through all of these files and run VASP on the configuration. We only need a single electronic minimization (no ion movement) since we are interested in the energy of the configuration.
5) Use "getoutcars.sh" to gather all of the OUTCAR files from all of the configurations and put them into an "outcar_house" directory.
	a) The OUTCAR files will be labeled with a number corresponding to their lattice parameter.
6) Once the OUTCARs are organized, go into the OUTCAR directory and run the Octave script "calc_lp.m". This script loops through all the OUTCARs and calculates the lattice parameter and gives a rough approximation to the bulk modulus.
	a) Be sure to edit "calc_lp.m" to loop through the OUTCARs that you have generated.
7) Use this lattice parameter as a basis for displacement configurations to generate forces in the next step.
